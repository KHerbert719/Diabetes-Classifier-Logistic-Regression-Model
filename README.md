# Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project builds a logistic regression classifier to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on 
medical diagnostic features. The model is trained on a dataset containing the following attributes:

- Glucose level
- Age
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Insulin level
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Number of pregnancies
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- **Outcome** (`0` = No diabetes, `1` = Has diabetes)

# Objective

To develop a binary classification model using logistic regression that can estimate the 
likelihood of diabetes in a patient based on included health indicators.

# Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC-AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix

# Files Included

- `Copy_of_Diabetes_Classifier.ipynb` — Main notebook for data exploration, model training, and evaluation
- `diabetes.csv` — Dataset used
- `Diabetes_Classifier_README.md` — Project overview
